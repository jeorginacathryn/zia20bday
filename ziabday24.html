  <h3>Poem ought to you:</h3>
  <p>
    I knew from that start it was you,
    how you colored my life from black
    to you<br>
    
    How you make me feel as time passes by,
    can never cease to believe my eye<br>
    
    I love you through every day and night,
    as you are a reason for my every light<br>
    
    Your presence makes me feel at ease,
    just you and me i'll always be at peace<br>
    
    A home is a place I call with you, 
    because I know you'll always be here<br>
    
    I hope you know how much I love you,
    because I'll always be here and near.<br>
  </p>
